To comply with homologation rules, BMW had to produce a limited number of road-going versions of the M3 GTR. These street-legal variants, often referred to as the “Strassenversion” (street version), were significantly detuned compared to their race-spec counterparts but still retained much of the aggressive styling and engineering excellence. With a slightly modified version of the 4.0L V8, the road car was reportedly capable of producing around 380 hp, an impressive figure for its time. It also featured an upgraded suspension, a stripped-down interior with racing-inspired elements, and extensive use of lightweight materials to maintain its performance edge. Given their extreme rarity—only around 10 units were ever built—these cars became instant collector’s items, with values skyrocketing over the years. Today, finding an original M3 GTR Strassenversion is almost impossible, and those that do surface command staggering prices due to their historical significance and exclusivity. Owning one is not just about having a rare BMW; it’s about possessing a piece of racing history that represents one of the most exciting periods in motorsport.
