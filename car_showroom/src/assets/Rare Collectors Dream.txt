Only a handful of road-legal versions were ever built, reportedly around 10 units. With its racing pedigree, lightweight carbon-fiber body, and raw performance, the E46 M3 GTR remains one of the most coveted BMWs ever made. Each of these cars was hand-built and featured extensive modifications to make them suitable for the road while retaining much of their track-bred DNA. The carbon fiber roof, hood, and aerodynamic enhancements reduced weight significantly, making the M3 GTR one of the lightest and most focused M cars ever produced. These rare road-going models were priced astronomically even when new, and today, their value has skyrocketed to millions of dollars, making them one of the holy grails for BMW collectors.
